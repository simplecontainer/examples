prefix: simplecontainer.io/v1
kind: resource
meta:
  group: mysql

spec:
  data:
    my.cnf: |
      [mysqld]
      bind-address=0.0.0.0
    secret.config.file: |
      if container has spec like this:
      
      configuration:
        password: 12345
        secret: 12345678
      
      then resource can parse those like this:
        This works -> (( lookup "simplecontainer.io/v1/kind/configuration/mysql/envs:password" )) # Fetched from store
        This works -> (( lookup "simplecontainer.io/v1/kind/secret/mysql/password:password" )) # Fetched from store
        This works -> (( lookup "configuration/mysql/envs:password" )) # Fetched from store
        This works -> (( lookup "secret/mysql/password:password" )) # Fetched from store
        
        This works -> (( .password )) # Parsed only when attached on the container
        This works -> (( .secret )) # Parsed only when attached on the container
