kind: resource
meta:
  group: mysql
  name: config
spec:
  data:
    my.cnf: |
      [mysqld]
      bind-address=0.0.0.0
    secret.config.file: |
      if container has spec like this:
      
        configuration:
          password: 12345
          secret: {{ secret.mysql.mysql.password }}
      
      then resource can parse those like this:
        This works -> {{ container.password }} # Fetched by the container and reused
        This works -> {{ container.fromConfig }} # Fetched by the container and reused
        This works -> {{ configuration.mysql.envs.password }} # Fetched directly as object
        This works -> {{ secret.mysql.mysql.password }} # Fetched directly as object
